## MDFourier for CPS1

This is a barebones implementation of MDFourier for the Capcom CP System 1 arcade PCB.

### SDK

It a fork of the ccps SDK by Fabien Sanglard: https://github.com/ArtemioUrbina/ccps

### PCB 

The fork uses the sf2ud PCB since that's what I had at hand, a build is provided under the out folder.

### TODO

Input needs to be fixed.
